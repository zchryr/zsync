# zsync

I created this project because I wanted to have more visibility into off-site backups that I'm running. I think [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) is amazing, so that's why this is basically just a wrapper around in written in Python with some extra Mattermost notification functionality. I know [zsync](http://zsync.moria.org.uk/) already exists, but I named it this before realizing that, and mainly because my name starts with a z.

## How To Run This
### docker-compose [option 1]
Using `docker-compose` you can use the example `docker-compose.yml` file includued in this repo. That file has the three volumes that you need to create and configure for this to work. I would recommend a command something like `docker-compose up && docker-compose down` to run this with compose.

### docker run [option 2]
If you would like to use a `docker run` command instead, here is an example
```
docker run --rm --name zsync \
-v /opt/zsync/args.json:/home/zsync/args.json:ro \
-v /opt/zsync/id_rsa:/home/zsync/.ssh/id_rsa:ro \
-v /opt/zsync/files-to-backup:/home/zsync/local:ro \
zacharyr/zsync:latest
```

### args.json [required]
This is a file that you NEED to edit. This file is used both by a bash script, and the python script. The scripts will not run if you do not edit this file.

### SSH Authentication [required]
You need to run `ssh-keygen`, create a `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` with an empty passphrase. I'm sure there is a better way doing authentication, but for now, this is how I've got this configured so it can be interactionless. Place the `id_rsa.pub` on the remote server in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

## How To Build This Yourself
`docker build .`

### Random
You can run this without needing docker, I just wouldn't recommend it. But if you want to, you'll need Python3, to install the packages in the `requirements.txt` file, and to do the above steps (minus the docker stuff).

### The Future
I want to add more error checking/handling into this project. I'm sure I can also add a lot more visibility into things, so more to come on that.
I might add Slack functionality into this later.
